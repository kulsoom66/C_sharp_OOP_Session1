# C_sharp_OOP_Session1

Here you'll discover code implementations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts that I've learned from an online course with some comments that may help you to understand.

In ConsoleApp1 folder you will find the following:
  1. In the classes `Employee` and `Car`, I've implemented the Encapsulation and Property concepts (with setter and getter).
  2. The `PhoneBook` class demonstrates the implementation of an Indexer.
  3. Within the "OOP" folder, you'll find the `Parent` and `Child` classes where I've implemented Inheritance.
  4. The `struct1` class provides insights into the usage of a struct.
  5. In the `Program` class, the `Main` method serves as the entry point, where all the objects are instantiated, and various methods are validated.
